# Tableau-Influenza
Using Excel and Tableau to assist a medical staffing company during influenza season
Four data sets were provided in Excel (US Census, CDC Influenza Deaths by State, CDC Influenza Hospital Visits by State, and Flu Shots Administered in Children). After the data was cleaned and wrangled in Excel, it had to be determined which states needed the most assistance with medical workers based off how hard they get hit with the flu in past years as well as their total population. Seasonality had to be taken into account as well, and lastly a high emphasis was placed on states that had a high population of vulnerable groups. The final recommendations was placed in a Tableau Storyboard.
